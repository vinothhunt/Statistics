Question1)
The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that during November, 83.4% of Southwest Airlines’ flights, 75.1% of US Airways’
flights, and 70.1% of JetBlue’s flights arrived on time (USA Today, January 4, 2007). Assume that this on-time performance is
applicable for flights arriving at concourse A of the Rochester International Airport, and that 40% of the arrivals at concourse
A are Southwest Airlines flights, 35% are US Airways flights, and 25% are JetBlue flights.
1)  Develop a joint probability table with three rows (airlines) and two columns (on-time arrivals vs. late arrivals).
2)  An announcement has just been made that Flight 1424 will be arriving at gate 20 in concourse A. What is the most likely airline for this arrival?
3)  What is the probability that Flight 1424 will arrive on time?
4)  Suppose that an announcement is made saying that Flight 1424 will be arriving late. What is the most likely airline for this arrival? What is the least likely airline?

Solution:
    On-Time   Late
SW  33.4      6.64
US  26.3      8.72  
JB  17.5      7.48

Question2)
Small cars get better gas mileage, but they are not as safe as bigger cars. Small cars accounted for 18% of the vehicles on the 
road, but accidents involving small cars led to 11,898 fatali- ties during a recent year (Reader’s Digest, May 2000). Assume the 
probability a small car is involved in an accident is .18. The probability of an accident involving a small car leading to a fatality 
is .128 and the probability of an accident not involving a small car leading to a fa- tality is .05. Suppose you learn of an accident 
involving a fatality. What is the probability a small car was involved? Assume that the likelihood of getting into an accident is 
independent of car size.

P(S) =18%
P(SA)=18%
Accident involve =11898
P(F/SA)=.128
P(F/Not SA)=0.05

P(SA/F) =   P(F/SA)*P(SA) / P(F/SA)*P(SA)+P(notSA)*P(F/notSA)
        =   0.128*.18 / (.128*.18)+(.005*.82)
        =   0.2304/.06404
        =   35.98%
        
Question 3)
A local bank reviewed its credit card policy with the intention of recalling some of its credit cards.
In the past approximately 5% of cardholders defaulted, leaving the bank unable to collect the outstanding balance. 
Hence, management established a prior probability of .05 that any particular cardholder will default. 
The bank also found that the probability of miss- ing a monthly payment is .20 for customers who do not default. Of course,
the probability of missing a monthly payment for those who default is 1.
a)Given that a customer missed one or more monthly payments, compute the posterior probability that the customer will default.
The bank would like to recall its card if the probability that a customer will default is greater than .20. Should the bank recall its card if the customer misses a monthly pay- ment? Why or why not?

P(D) = 0.05
P(MP/ND) = 0.20
P(MP/D)=1
P(D/MP) =?
          P(D)*P(MP/D) /  P(D)*P(MP/D)+ P(notD)*P(MP/notD)
          =.05*1/0.05*1 + .95*.20
          =.0.05/0.24
          =20.8
